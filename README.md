AS Airman Snuffy
When I navigate to a todo list and click on the “complete” checkbox
Then I should see the item written

As a field technician, I want to be able to easily log and submit reports using a mobile app,
so that I can efficiently document my work, observations, and any issues encountered while on-site.

Acceptance Criteria:

The app should allow me to create a new report by capturing essential details such as:

        Date and time of the report

        Location or site information

        Type of work performed or issue identified

        Detailed description of the work or issue

        Ability to attach relevant photos or files

        Customer or client information (if applicable)

The app should provide a user-friendly interface for filling out the report fields, with appropriate input validation and error handling.

The app should allow me to save a draft of the report if I need to pause and resume later, without losing the entered data.

The app should have a submit functionality that securely transmits the completed report to the designated server or database for further processing and storage.

The app should provide a confirmation message or notification upon successful submission of the report.

The app should allow me to view a history of my previously submitted reports, including the ability to search and filter based on relevant criteria such as date range or report type.

The app should have an offline capability, allowing me to create and save reports even when there is no internet connectivity, and automatically synchronize the reports when a connection is restored.

The app should ensure data security and privacy, with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive information.

The app should be compatible with the commonly used mobile devices and operating systems used by the field technicians.

The app should have a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a seamless user experience on various devices.
